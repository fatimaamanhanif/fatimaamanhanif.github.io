<section>
  <p>

  Points to consider for sleeping well: </p>

</ul>
<p>There are many benefits of good sleep like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">improves focus</span>,</li>
  <li><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">improves mood</span>,</li>
<li><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">reduces stress</span>, etc.

</li></ul>

    <h3>Improves focus</h3>

    <p>Having high focus is significant in various situations like driving, exams,etc. Constantly zoning out due to lack of sleep can be dangerous when you are driving or cooking. </p>


    <h3>Improves mood</h3>



    <p>Have you noticed how when you are sleep deprived you get irritated way easily?</p>
<h3>Reduces stress</h3>
    <p>Did you ever
      think why your
       parents ask you to go
        to bed early before an important exam or presentation? Because whem you do not sleep enough, you stress more. Next time, rather than staying up late to revise more, go to bed
      early to score more.</p>
